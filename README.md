# КМК Viewer

This application is being developed to simplify the process of collecting and analyzing a clinical blood metabogram.

At the moment, only the application framework has been implemented.
Only functionality has been implemented that does not depend on external factors, such as the IBMC server or a real physical questionnaire.

Currently, IBMC has expressed its intention to use Kotlin Multiplatform to implement UI using native methods. 
Therefore, this repository is archival, and the functionality in it is brought only to the required point,
which will satisfy the requirements of the coursework from MIREA!
